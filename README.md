# Right the Hand
![demo](https://lyonlu13.github.io/assets/img/collection/right_the_hand.png)

A to-do list application that can be expanded from the right side of your screen by hotkeys.  With Firebase, lists could be syncable between devices. However, the API key in my source code is discarded. If you want to give it a try, you might need to replace it with yours.

By the way, the to-do list function is implemented by React, and you can find it at "react-note-bulks". :)
